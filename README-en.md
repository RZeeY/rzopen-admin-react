## Programming Recommendations

- Common components are placed in the `src/components` folder. Use the `rz-` prefix for naming, such as `rz-route-defender`.
- Page-specific components are placed in the `src/views/page-folder-name/components` folder. Use the `s-` prefix for naming, such as `s-card-overview`.
- Global style class names use the `global-` prefix, such as `global-card-border`.
